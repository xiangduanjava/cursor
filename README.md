# 简介
Cursor 是集成了 GPT-4 的 IDE 工具，目前免费并且无需 API Key，支持 Win、Mac、Linux 平台，可以按要求生成代码，或者让 AI 帮助优化代码，分析代码。Cursor目前已经集成了openai的GPT-4，它或将彻底改变我们写代码的方式。

## Getting Started

Head over to [our website](https://cursor.so/) to download and try out the editor.

## Features

It's early days, but right now Cursor can help you with a few things...

-   **Chat**: Talk with a bot that understands your entire code base
-   **Edit**: Ask the AI to change a block of code, see an inline diff of the edits
-   **Debug**: Hover over linter errors or stack traces to auto-fix them

[See here](https://cursor.sh/features) for more info on Cursor's features.

## Roadmap

Long term, our plan is to build Cursor into the world's most productive development environment. Using LLMs, we want to do things like:

-   "Heal" your repository when you're halfway through a refactor
-   Allow you to code by editing a "pseudocode" version of your codebase
-   Auto-fix errors as soon as they show up in your terminal
-   Embed AI-written documentation into the UI

## OSS

We'd previously open-sourced our old Codemirror-based editor. You can find that code [here](https://github.com/getcursor/cursor-codemirror).

The VSCodium-based version of Cursor is not open-sourced, but we may open up parts or all of it in the future. Our [prompting library](https://github.com/anysphere/priompt) is open source.
